Overview:

"The Black Cat" is a Unity project developed for a Hackathon competition in 2023. It's a combination of a story-driven narrative and a memory-based card matching game with a quiz component. Players will immerse themselves in a mysterious story while testing their memory and knowledge through gameplay.

## Story:

In "The Black Cat," players embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of a quaint town plagued by strange occurrences. As they progress through the game, they will encounter intriguing characters, solve puzzles, and ultimately unravel the mystery behind the enigmatic black cat that prowls the streets.

## Gameplay:

### Card Matching Game:
The core gameplay revolves around a classic card matching mechanic.
Players are presented with a grid of face-down cards, each containing different symbols or images.
The objective is to flip over pairs of cards to find matching pairs.
Successfully matched pairs remain face-up, while unmatched pairs are flipped face-down again.
The game continues until all pairs are successfully matched.
### Quiz Component:
After completing a round of card matching, players are presented with a timed quiz.
The quiz features questions related to the story, characters, or general knowledge.
Players must answer as many questions as possible within the time limit to progress in the game.
Correct answers contribute to the player's progress, while incorrect answers may result in penalties or setbacks.
### Controls:
Card Matching: Click or tap on cards to flip them over.
Quiz: Select answers using the mouse or touchscreen.
